- **VERY IMPORTANT**: Do not perform any changes to the codebase or documentation (except creation of tasks themselves) without this to be asked in a task file in docs/tasks/ folder. You should only suggest changes if you are asked to do so in a task file. Read the instructions in /.github/instructions/task-creator-instructions.instructions.md carefully and follow them exactly.
