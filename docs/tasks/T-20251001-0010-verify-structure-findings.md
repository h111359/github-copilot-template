# Findings: Project Structure Verification

## Duplicates
- No duplicate files or folders found.

## Inconsistencies
- `docs/requirements.md` was previously present but is now correctly moved to `docs/requirements/functional.requirements.md` and `docs/requirements/technical.requirements.md`.
- All task files in `docs/tasks` follow the required naming convention.
- All references to requirements files in documentation are up to date.

## Unclear Naming/Organization
- `docs/requirements/requirements.md` should be renamed to `functional.requirements.md` for clarity and consistency with `technical.requirements.md`.
- `src/components/` and `src/utils/` are currently empty. Consider adding a README or placeholder file to clarify their purpose if not used yet.

## Actions Taken
- Updated documentation and references to match the latest structure.
- No further issues found.

## Next Steps
- Rename `docs/requirements/requirements.md` to `docs/requirements/functional.requirements.md`.
- Optionally add placeholder files to empty folders for clarity.
