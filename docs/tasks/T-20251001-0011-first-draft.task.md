# Task: First Draft Implementation

## Objective
Create the first draft of the game according to the requirements and initial design. This draft should:
- Implement the basic game loop and main UI structure.
- Include placeholder graphics, effects, and sound assets.
- Ensure the game is playable in the browser with minimal features.
- Follow the folder structure and technical constraints specified in the documentation.

## Requirements Reference
- Functional requirements: `docs/requirements/functional.requirements.md`
- Technical requirements: `docs/requirements/technical.requirements.md`
- Architecture: `docs/architecture.md`
- Folder structure: `docs/folder-structure.md`

## Acceptance Criteria
- Game loads and runs in browser without errors.
- Main UI is present and interactive (even if minimal).
- Basic game logic is implemented (e.g., turn-based actions, win/lose conditions).
- Placeholder assets are used for graphics and sound.
- Code is modular and documented.
- README, requirements, developer-guide, user-guide, architecture, and tasks-catalog are updated after changes.

## Steps
1. Implement main UI and game loop in `src/app.js`, `src/index.html`, and `src/styles.css`.
2. Add placeholder assets in `src/assets/`.
3. Ensure code is modular (use `src/components/` and `src/utils/` as needed).
4. Update documentation files after changes.
5. Test game in browser for basic functionality.

## Notes
- Do not implement advanced features or polish at this stage.
- Focus on structure, playability, and compliance with requirements.
- Document any assumptions or limitations in the README.
