# Requirements Outcome (First Draft)

## Folder Structure Alignment
The folder structure supports all functional and technical requirements:
- Modular organization for game logic, graphics, and assets.
- Documentation and guides in `docs/`.
# File and Folder Structure

## src/
- `index.html`: Main HTML file
- `styles.css`: Game styles

- `assets/`: Images, sounds, and other assets
- `components/`: Modular JavaScript files for different parts of the game (e.g., player, enemy, battle system)
- `utils/`: Utility functions (e.g., random number generation, animations)

## Root
- `README.md`: Instructions on how to run the game

## docs/
- `tasks/`: Folder with *.tasks.md files
- `tasks-catalog.md`: List of all tasks and their status (done, in progress, to do)
- `user-guide.md`: Instructions for users
- `developer-guide.md`: Instructions for developers
- `architecture.md`: Architecture and design description
- `folder-structure.md`: This file, describing the file and folder structure
