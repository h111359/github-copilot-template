# Task Execution Log: Verify Project Structure

**Task:** T-20251001-0010-verify-structure.task.md
**Start Time:** 2025-10-01 15:30

## Plan
- List all files and folders in the workspace.
- Compare against docs/folder-structure.md.
- Identify and document any duplicates, inconsistencies, or unclear items.
- Fix all issues found (rename, move, delete, clarify).
- Update documentation and catalog.

## Execution Steps & Explanations
1. Listed all files and folders using workspace directory tools.
2. Compared actual structure to the specification in docs/folder-structure.md.
3. Checked for duplicate files/folders: none found.
4. Checked for inconsistencies:
   - requirements.md was previously present but is now correctly split into functional and technical requirements.
   - All references to requirements files in documentation are up to date.
   - All task files follow the required naming convention.
5. Checked for unclear naming/organization:
   - src/components/ and src/utils/ were empty, so README files were added for clarity.
6. Documented findings in a separate findings file.
7. Marked the verification task as done in tasks-catalog.md.

## Issues Found
- requirements.md needed to be renamed and split for clarity (already done).
- Empty folders needed clarification (README files added).

## Solutions Taken
- Updated documentation and references.
- Added README files to empty folders.

## Notes
- No further issues found. Structure is now clear and maintainable.
- All actions are traceable in this log and the findings file.
