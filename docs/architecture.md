# Architecture

## Overview
- The game is a single-page web app using vanilla JS, HTML5, and CSS3.
- All logic runs in the browser; no server-side code.
- Graphics and animations are rendered using the HTML5 canvas.
- Pokemon sprites are animated using custom JS logic in `assets/pokemon-sprites.js`.

## Main Components
- **Game UI**: Canvas for battle, controls for actions, info panel for status.
- **Game Logic**: Handles Pokemon selection, turn-based battle, win/loss conditions.
- **Animation System**: Animates Pokemon and attack effects using requestAnimationFrame.
- **Modular Structure**: Components and utils folders for maintainability and extensibility.

## Extensibility
- New Pokemon, moves, and effects can be added easily.
- UI and graphics can be enhanced with more CSS and canvas features.
